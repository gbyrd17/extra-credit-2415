# Extra Credit work for Dr. Lidke's PHYS2415 Computational Physics Class
***
This is not only my submission for problem 5, but the solutions to the other problems are *also* included within this repo. Questions 2 and 4 have full solutions, 1 and 3 were not completed, and the sudoku one is only comments.

Each repo is named accordingly, and the language the problem is solved with is consistant within the problems, but not across every problem.

PDF's are created via the LaTeX environment, and all required files are included within their respective branches.

Thank you.
